# PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor example for OpenShift User Workload Monitoring

## PodMonitor

To verify Prometheus scraping metrics we should have - one or more - Pods that log incoming requests (e.g. Apache Httpd) and a _PodMonitor_:

```
$ oc apply -f pod.yaml
$ oc apply -f podmonitor.yaml
```

Alternatively Pods can be created by a _Deployment_ or _StatefulSet_ too.

In the Pod log we should see lines like:

```
10.128.1.10 - - [05/Jan/2022:19:28:17 +0000] "GET /podmonitor-http HTTP/1.1" 404 196 "-" "Prometheus/2.29.2"
```

As we use an empty _httpd_ container, Prometheus gets an HTTP 404 and no metrics are collected, but it indicates that Prometheus is trying to collect the metrics.

[NOTE]
If we have any NetworkPolicy (see `oc get networkpolicy`) in our namespace, the connection from `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace may be blocked. Apply `networkpolicy.yaml` to allow incoming requests from Prometheus.

## ServiceMonitor

We can also use a _ServiceMonitor_ instead of a _PodMonitor_ to configure the metrics collection.

```
$ oc apply -f pod.yaml
$ oc apply -f service.yaml
$ oc apply -f servicemonitor.yaml
```

Prometheus will scrape the Pods "behind" the _Service_ - including non-ready Pods.

In the Pod log we should see lines like:

```
10.128.1.10 - - [05/Jan/2022:19:28:19 +0000] "GET /servicemonitor-web HTTP/1.1" 404 196 "-" "Prometheus/2.29.2"
10.128.1.10 - - [05/Jan/2022:19:28:22 +0000] "GET /servicemonitor-webssl HTTP/1.1" 404 196 "-" "Prometheus/2.29.2"
```
