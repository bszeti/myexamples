If an application logs in multiple log files with different format sending all logs to stdout is not a great option. Using a sidecar that tails the file on its own stdout can help. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#using-a-sidecar-container-with-the-logging-agent

Try Pod:

```
oc create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - |
      for i in {1000..1009}; do
      for j in {1000..1019}; do
          echo "console - \$i.\$j"
          # Log to file tailed by side container
          echo "filelog - \$i.\$j" >>/shared/my.log
          sleep 1
      done
      # Rotate log
      mv -f /shared/my.log /shared/my.log.1
      done
    image: ubi9:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /shared
      name: shared
  - name: sidecar
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - "-c"
    - tail -F -n +1 /shared/my.log
    image: ubi9:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /shared
      name: shared
  volumes:
  - name: shared
    emptyDir:
      sizeLimit: 500Mi
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF
```

[NOTE]
Tail needs a couple of seconds to notice the log rotation, so if two rotations happens to quickly, it may miss a file. Usually this is not a problem.
